NUMBERS

There are three types of numeric values in python
- int		x = 1
- float		y = 2.8
- complex	z = 1j


- int: Whole number, positive pr negative, without decimals and of unlimited length.
- float: Positive or negative number containing one or more decimal points. Can also be scientific with an "e" to indicate the power of 10. (-87.7e100)
- complex: written with a "j" as the imaginary part.


# Conversion of  numeric data types
- For this you need to create a new variable and assign the changed data type to the existing variable.
- Example:
		x = 5
		y = float(x)

Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.

# Random Numbers
- For generating random numbers we import the random module and then print the random number within a defined range.
- Examples:
		import random
		print(random.randrange(1,10))


# Casting
- Casting is used to assign datatypes for variables manually.
- Example:
		x = int(3)
		y = str("Name")
		z = float(5)
