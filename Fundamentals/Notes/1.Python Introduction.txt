PYTHON INTRODUCTION

# What is Python
- Python is a programming language released in 1991.
- Used for
	Web development (Server Side)
	Software development
	Mathematics
	System Scripting


# What can Python do
- Can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Can connect to database systems and can also read and modify files.
- Can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.


# Why Python
- Works on various platform.
- Simple syntax
- Allows developers to write programs in fewer lines.
- Code can be executed as soon as it is written.


# Syntax
- Python uses a new line to complete a command.
- Python relies on indentation, using whitespaces, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.


# NOTE: PYTHON CAN ALSO RUN ON COMMAND LINE
- Type "python" / "py" in your command line and start scripting.
- to exit type command exit()


# Syntax
- Python can be directly run from command line or a py file can be created and then run the python file.
- Indentation is very important in python. It determines the syntax of your program.
- Example:	if 5 > 2:
			print("Five is greater than 2")

- If you skip the indentation before the second line, the code may give you an error.
- You have to use same number of spaces in the same block of code.


# COMMENTS
- Comments are used to document code, make it more readable and prevent execution when testing code.
- Comments are given by using this symbol "#"
- Multi Line comments are given by (""") at the start and end of the comments.
